# Speaker Classification

This repository contains the code for the signal processing course project.

## Introduction
Machine learning consists of building systems based on data. These types of systems are very popular nowadays. The goal of this project is to give you an intuition of the advantages of machine learning-based systems. You are going to implement a rule-based system using signal processing techniques and compare it to machine learning techniques. The subject of this project is an application that classifies speakers, which means that it recognizes different speakers. Your application will base its classification on the voices of the speakers. Speaker classification is different from speech recognition whose goal is to recognize what is being said by a speaker.
